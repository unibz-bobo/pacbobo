# pacbobo
The pacbobo tool is a thin wrapper arround the
[pacman package manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman).
It adds the customized Bobo package repository as a source by 
modification of the pacman configuration file. The tool can be used just 
like `pacman`, ie. `pacbobo -Syu`, `pacbobo -S <package-name>` ect.

For further details see also the archlinux wiki article about
[unofficial user repositories](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unofficial_user_repositories).
